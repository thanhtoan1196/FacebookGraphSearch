## Finding an event ##

/search/str/*NAME*/events-named

## Location of events ##

/search/*PLACE-ID*/events-at/

## Time of an event ##

Have Unicorn produce a list of dates - see: [Looking for dates](fgs
-dates.md) -, and filter them for events:

/search/*DATE*/date/event

## Participants ##

There is no way known to me to filter for participants of an event - if it is public, you can go and click on the lists "Joined", "Interested", "not going" (but invited). 

It does work the other way round, though: 

/search/*PROFILE-ID*/events-joined/
