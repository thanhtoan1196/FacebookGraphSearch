## Interesting questions ##

* Are there any wildcars?
* Is there any sensible relationship to Facebook Graph API queries, as they may be used with the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)?
* To complete the UNION and INTERSECT keywords obviously lent from SQL, is there any way to EXCLUDE hits from a result?
