All these queries produce a list of groups. 

## Selecting groups by name ##

## Selecting the groups someone is a member in ##

Basically, the /groups selector takes everything that selects a person or a group of people - see *[Looking for people](fgs-people.md)*

* /search/PROFILE-ID/groups/
* /search/*PLACE-ID*/residents/groups/
* /search/*PAGE-ID*/likers/group
* /search/*PAGE-ID*/employees/group

Groups may be either open or closed (hidden groups can't be queried, of course).
